<h1>Gardenverse Website</h1>
<p>Gardenverse is a fully mobile-friendly website that brings together all the HTML skills I've learned so farâ€”tables, forms, semantic layout, navigation menus, and both ordered and unordered lists. Designed as an all-in-one gardening guide, it offers helpful info for everyone from first-time planters to seasoned growers. Every page is built to meet modern web standards for accessibility, structure, and usability.</p>
